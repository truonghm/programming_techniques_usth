Exercice 1: Point2D class
Consider a class Point2D representing a point in space 2D and characterized by two coordinates x and y.
1. Write the code of a class Point2D allowing to represent this class and its attributes with :
â€” a constructor by default initializes the values of x and y to 0 ;
â€” a constructor which initializes the values of x and y to values passed in parameter.
2. Add in this class the accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) of the attributes x and y
